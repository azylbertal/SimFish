# SimFish

A simulated zebrafish larvae for a 2D environment created using deep Q learning. Original codebase at https://bitbucket.org/azylbertal/simfish/src/master/

To run:
  1. Install dependencies using "pip install requirements.txt"
  2. Create environment by navigating to Configurations, and running "python create_base_configuration.py test"
  3. Run the "run.py" file, from which the configuration can be adjusted.
  4. To test the environment, run the "run_environment_test.py" file. Note that for Linux this will require installation of tkinter, which can be done using "sudo apt-get install python3-tk"
