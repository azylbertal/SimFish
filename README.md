# SimFish

A simulated zebrafish larvae for a 2D environment created using deep Q learning. Developed from project at https://bitbucket.org/azylbertal/simfish/src/master/

To run:
  1. Install dependencies using "pip install requirements.txt"
  2. Run the "run.py" file, from which the chosen environment name and trial number can be adjusted.
  3. This will create the necessary files (given a bespoke "create_configuration_{environment}.py" file)
  4. To test the environment, run the "run_environment_test.py" file. Note that for Linux this will require installation of tkinter, which can be done using "sudo apt-get install python3-tk"
